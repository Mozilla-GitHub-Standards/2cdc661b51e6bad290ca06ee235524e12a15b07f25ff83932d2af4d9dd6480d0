This is a quick introduction post from the MozMEAO Site Reliability Engineers. As SRE's at Mozilla, [Josh](https://github.com/jgmize) and [I](https://github.com/metadave) are responsible for infrastructure, automation, and operations for several sites, including [mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org).

We try to keep much of our work as public as possible, so we've created [https://github.com/mozmar/infra](https://github.com/mozmar/infra) to share some of our automation and tooling. We have additional internal repos to manage some of our private infrastructure as well. 

Feel free to try out our scripts and tools, and let us know via Github [issue](https://github.com/mozmar/infra/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/mozmar/infra/pulls) if we've missed anything.
